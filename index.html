            <h1>Genres</h1>
            <div class="genre-desc">
                <h2>A movie genre is a category that groups films based on shared themes, storytelling styles, and emotional tones. Genres help audiences know what kind of experience to expect—whether it's the excitement of action, the tension of horror, the imagination of sci-fi, the humor of comedy, or the emotion of drama. While each genre has its own conventions, many films blend multiple genres to create unique and engaging stories.</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="accordion">
                <h3>Action</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Action films are built around excitement, physical movement, and high-energy sequences such as fights, explosions, car chases, and intense battles. These movies are crafted to deliver adrenaline and visual spectacle, often featuring heroes overcoming impossible odds.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The action genre emerged strongly in the 1930s and 1940s with adventure serials and war films, but it exploded in popularity in the 1980s with stars like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis. Modern action films often blend CGI with practical effects, creating large-scale blockbusters.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Adventure</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Adventure movies focus on exploration, discovery, and epic journeys. They often take place in exotic environments—jungles, deserts, oceans, or ancient ruins—and follow characters on quests or missions.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            One of the earliest film genres, adventure storytelling goes back to silent cinema with films like “The Thief of Bagdad” (1924). Later, franchises like Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean revived interest by combining adventure with fantasy and action.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Comedy</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Comedy films are made to entertain and bring laughter through humor, exaggeration, witty dialogue, and social satire. They explore everyday life in a lighthearted way or use absurd scenarios to make audiences laugh.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Comedy is one of the oldest film genres, with roots in early silent-era slapstick featuring Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. It evolved over time into many styles: romantic comedies, dark comedies, parodies, and more.

                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Drama films focus on emotional storytelling and realistic, human-driven narratives. They explore conflict, relationships, personal growth, and everyday struggles.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Drama has been central to filmmaking since the beginning, inspired by theatrical traditions. Classic Hollywood dramas in the 1930s–1950s helped define character-driven storytelling, while modern dramas often tackle social issues or psychological themes.

                    <h3>Horror</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Horror movies aim to scare, shock, or unsettle audiences through suspense, dark visuals, supernatural elements, or psychological tension. They tap into primal fears and uncomfortable emotions.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Horror originated from early Gothic literature and silent films like Nosferatu (1922). The genre has evolved through major eras—classic monster movies in the 1930s, psychological horror in the 60s and 70s, slashers in the 80s, and modern elevated horror with deeper themes.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Thriller</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Thrillers are suspense-driven films built around tension, uncertainty, and high stakes. They often involve crime, mystery, espionage, or psychological mind games, keeping the audience on edge.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The thriller genre was shaped heavily by director Alfred Hitchcock, whose films in the mid-20th century set the standard for suspense. Over time, thrillers expanded into subgenres like psychological thrillers, crime thrillers, and political thrillers.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Romance</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Romance films center on love, emotional connection, and the journey of relationships. They explore themes like attraction, heartbreak, sacrifice, and personal growth through love.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Romance has been a core movie genre since early cinema, with classic Hollywood films shaping the “love story” formula. Modern romance includes romantic comedies, tragic romances, and contemporary love stories that reflect social changes.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Sci-Fi</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Sci-fi movies explore futuristic concepts, advanced technology, space travel, parallel universes, and scientific possibilities. They often ask philosophical questions about humanity, society, and the unknown.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Early sci-fi films like Metropolis (1927) imagined futuristic worlds long before they existed. The genre boomed during the space race of the 1950s–60s and transformed again in the late 20th century with Star Wars, Blade Runner, and The Matrix.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Fantasy</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Fantasy films involve magical elements, mythical creatures, alternate worlds, and supernatural powers. They break from reality and often revolve around heroic quests or epic battles between good and evil.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Fantasy traces back to early cinema trick films, such as Georges Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon (1902). The genre surged with modern adaptations like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, which combined storytelling with advanced visual effects.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Animation</h3>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                        Animation uses illustrated or computer-generated imagery to tell stories that can span any genre—from adventure to drama. Its visual freedom allows for imaginative worlds and expressive characters.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Early animation began with hand-drawn frames in the early 1900s, evolving through Walt Disney’s innovations in the 1930s. The 1990s brought a major shift with CGI films like Toy Story, and animation continues to expand globally with styles like anime and stop-motion.
